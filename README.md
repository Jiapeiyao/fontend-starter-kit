## Why do you need to take a look at this (, as a web beginner) ? 
You may learn some html, css, and javascript from some online tutorials, but still have no idea what does a frontend engineering project look like and how to build one. It's not trivial to intergrate everything into a complete working project. Thanks to createapp.dev, it has became much easier to create a start kit, but I recommend you to read and understand webpack config, ts config, and so on, so that you can modify the settings to create your own project based on the start kit.
