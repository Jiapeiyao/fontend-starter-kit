## Use as Coding Playground (single page app / ui component library)
1. Enter a folder 
2. ```npm install```
3. ```npm start```

## Make use of the starter kit
1. Download this project or subset of the start kits
2. Create your project folder, then
    ```sh

4. Remember to change the project name, description, and etc in ```package.json```

## Why do you need to take a look at this (, as a web beginner) ? 
You may learn some html, css, and javascript from some online tutorials, but still have no idea what does a frontend engineering project look like and how to build one. It's not trivial to intergrate everything into a complete working project. Thanks to createapp.dev, it has became much easier to create a starter kit, but I recommend you to read and understand webpack config, ts config, and so on, so that you can modify the settings to create your own project based on the start kit.

## To-do List
1. Internationalization
2. Multi-theme/multi-skin
3. Unit test framework
4. Add a node server setting
5. Add a node server-rendering setting (maybe)
6. Add a vscode-extension setting
